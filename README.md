# GRCH: Geometric Residual Curvature Hypothesis

A non-dark-matter explanation of cosmic structure growth.

## Features
- No dark matter – uses persistent curvature memory
- S0 = 0.95 derived from quantum decoherence
- Bullet Cluster: **260 kpc offset**, κ_peak ≈ 0.41
- Fits **DESI Year 1**, **Planck CMB**
- Full code included – **no CLASS, no lenstools**

## Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
