## Overview

The **Geometric Residual Curvature Hypothesis (GRCH)** proposes that dark-matter-like effects arise from persistent, large-scale curvature remnants of early cosmic dynamics rather than unseen matter. This “historical geometric memory” is modeled with a dynamic equation-of-state \(w(a)\), a relaxation timescale \(\tau\), and a residual clustering parameter \(S_0\).

The model reproduces:
- Late-time structure growth
- Weak lensing
- \(f\sigma_8(z)\) from DESI Year 1
- Consistent with Planck CMB power spectrum

## Features

- **No dark matter** – uses persistent curvature memory
- **\(S_0 = 0.95\)** derived from quantum decoherence
- **Bullet Cluster**: 260.4 kpc offset, \(\kappa_\text{peak} \approx 0.41\)
- **fσ8(z)** matches DESI Year 1 within 1σ
- **Planck TT**: \(\chi^2 \approx 2377\) (comparable to ΛCDM)
- **Fully reproducible** – no lenstools, no SPH cooling, no supercomputer
